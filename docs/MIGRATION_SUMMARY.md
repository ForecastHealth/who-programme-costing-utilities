# Database Migration Summary

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

The WHO CHOICE Price Database has been fully recovered and is ready for use.

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Schema Analysis ✅
- Reverse-engineered all 9 database table schemas from source code
- Documented in `database_schemas.md`

### 2. Excel Data Extraction ✅
- Created `populate_database.py` to extract data from Excel file
- Successfully populated 7 tables from `5 WHO_CHOICE_Price_Database_2019_A3.xlsx`

### 3. External Data Migration ✅
- Created `migrate_country_data.py` to migrate remaining tables
- Successfully migrated 2 tables from `CountryData.db`

## Final Database Status

- **Population data**: 1950-2100 (151 years)
- **Cost data**: Primarily 2019 with some 2022 prices

## Key Data Elements

### From Excel File (5 WHO_CHOICE_Price_Database_2019_A3.xlsx)
- ✅ Personnel salaries by ISCO-08 level (1-5)
- ✅ Per diem rates (national, provincial, district)

- ✅ Population data (200 countries, 1950-2100, median variant)

## Verification Tests Passed ✅

1. ✅ Population query (Uganda 2019): 44,270 thousand = 44.27 million
2. ✅ PPP conversion factor (USA 2019): 1.0
3. ✅ GDP deflator (Uganda): Available for all years
4. ✅ Currency rebasement: UGA → USD conversion working
5. ✅ All 9 tables present and populated
6. ✅ Application functions working with migrated data

## How to Use

### Recreate the Database

```bash
# Step 1: Populate from Excel
python3 populate_database.py

# Step 2: Migrate from CountryData.db
python3 migrate_country_data.py
```

### Run the Application

```bash
# Test with sample input
python3 main.py -i your_input.json -o output

# Or use the API
python3 api.py
```

### Verify Data

```python
import sqlite3
from programme_costing_utilities import calculations

conn = sqlite3.connect('./data/who_choice_price_database.db')

# Test population lookup
pop = calculations.serve_population('UGA', 2019, conn)
print(f"Uganda 2019 population: {pop:,.0f} thousand")

# Test salary lookup
salary, currency_info = calculations.serve_personnel_annual_salary('UGA', 2, conn)
print(f"Uganda cadre 2 salary: {salary:,.2f} {currency_info}")

conn.close()
```

## Files Created

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `database_schemas.md` | Complete documentation of all table schemas |
| `populate_database.py` | Script to populate database from Excel file |
| `migrate_country_data.py` | Script to migrate data from CountryData.db |
| `DATABASE_RECOVERY.md` | Comprehensive recovery guide and documentation |
| `MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md` | This summary document |
| `./data/who_choice_price_database.db` | **The complete database** |

## Important Notes

### Population Data
- Values are in **thousands** (e.g., 44,270 = 44.27 million people)
- Aggregated from age groups 0-100 and both sexes
- Variant: "Median" (medium projection)

### Currency Codes
- "I$" = International dollars (PPP-adjusted)
- "USD" or "USA" = US dollars (code uses both)
- Other currencies use ISO3 country codes

### Economic Statistics
- Column format: `"1960 [YR1960]"`, `"1961 [YR1961]"`, etc.
- Series types:
  - PPP conversion factor, GDP (LCU per international $)
  - GDP deflator (base year varies by country)

### Personnel Cadre Levels
- Level 1: Services
- Level 2: Support staff
- Level 3: Technicians
- Level 4: Professionals
- Level 5: Managers

## Next Steps (Optional)

To further validate the database:

1. **Run comprehensive tests**
   ```bash
   python3 -m pytest tests/
   ```

2. **Test with known scenarios**
   - Create test JSON files with known countries
   - Verify cost calculations match expectations
   - Compare with previous outputs if available

3. **Document any missing data**
   - Some countries may not have complete data
   - GDP per capita data not yet included (was not needed)
   - Some items may need price updates
